## Goal
Create a strongly typed library of fundamental data structures and algorithms using the TypeScript language spec that is
 * intuitive
 * simple to use
 * well documented both in code and external docs
 * loosely coupled to other api (if any)

## Rules
The only rule is that there are no rules!! Of course, there are reasonable restrictions to this ;-) - keep the goals in mind and action.
Right now, this is just an open green field for all to contribute, fix and change.

## Contributing bug fixes
Currently accepting contributions in the form of bug fixes. Standards to follow.

## Contributing features
Currently accepting most contributions. Standards to follow.

## Legal
No legal clauses at the moment, but for the fact that the authors and contributors are not liable in any shape or form :-).

## Housekeeping

## Tests
